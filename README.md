# MyWindowsDriver
Last Update: May~Sep 2012 (Not sure). Driver for Windows (XP/7).

May be still usable on Windows 10 I don't know and won't test it anymore.

This is a project for me to create different Windows drivers to perform System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) Hook in old days (before I went to University).
