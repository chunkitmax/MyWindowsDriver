# MyWindowsDriver
Last Update: May~Sep 2012 (Not sure). Driver for Windows (XP/7).

May be still usable on Windows 10 I don't know and won't test it anymore.

This is a project for me to create different Windows drivers to perform System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) Hook in old days (before I went to University).

## Project (File Protecting):  
- [MyWindowsDriver(Using FilesProtect_SSDT_Hook.cpp) [C++/C]](https://github.com/chunkitmax/MyWindowsDriver) builds Windows driver for controlling or overriding kernel APIs
- [FilesProtect_Dll [VB.Net COM dll]](https://github.com/chunkitmax/TestMyDriver_FilesProtect) provides utilty functions
- [TestMyDriver_FilesProtect [VB.Net]](https://github.com/chunkitmax/TestMyDriver_FilesProtect) loads and communicates with driver
